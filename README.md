# Python-project - J.A.R.V.I.S.

JARVIS is an AI-powered virtual assistant designed to assist users with a wide range of tasks through voice commands. Inspired by the fictional assistant from the Iron Man series, JARVIS employs speech recognition technology to understand user queries and responds with actions like playing music, opening web searches, providing time and date information, and engaging in conversations using AI-generated responses. By leveraging the OpenAI GPT-3 API, JARVIS can generate contextually relevant replies, making interactions more personalized and intuitive. With its ability to adapt to user preferences and perform both basic and advanced functions, JARVIS aims to streamline daily tasks and enhance user productivity.
